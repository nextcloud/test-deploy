# AppAPI: deployment test

This repository is used in [AppAPI](https://github.com/nextcloud/app_api) as a test application when you click on the "Test Deploy" button

It differs from skeleton in that there are images of Python separately for CPU, AMD and NVIDIA.

Here is also slightly modified logic and more logs to make it easier to determine what is wrong in the Deploy Daemon config.
